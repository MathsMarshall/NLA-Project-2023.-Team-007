# NLA-Project-2023: Team-007
This was a project of some skoltech students, where the task was the implementation of a Block like Cholesky Matrix Factorization: https://doi.org/10.1002/nla.2497

In the paper, it is acknowledged that block algorithms are generally faster than other algorithms, and householder transformations are more stable. So the author proposes a method that tries to take advantage of the best of both worlds. In this repository, we implement from ground up (using only basic Numpy functions and mathplotlib), the algorithms in the paper, specifically: algorithm 1, algorithm 2 and algorithm 3.

In each function we implemented, we have included a documentation for the user to know what type of matrices each function accepts as an input. We have also enabled the functions to give error where necessary as a guide to the user to edit the function inputs.
